# How High Can You Drop Your Phone?

A game where you throw your phone as high as possible.
It works by using your device's accelerometer to detect its G-forces. 
When the phone has approximately 0Gs it means that the phone is in free fall. 
Simply calculate the time the device is in 0G and use it to get height.
